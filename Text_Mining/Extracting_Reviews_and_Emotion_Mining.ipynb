       "' quality and lightweight watch always fan of titian raga     good   it is very nice  sooo beautiful  light weight  gifted by my hubby    i am soo happy    thanks      firstly the watch is light weight   smart looking   has 2 swarovski crystals on it which makes it more attractive     but when it is taken in the hand it feels like any 1st copy watches that are available in the market thus i feel that it is a bit overpriced than the quality of the product     after using only it ll be possible to say about the battery   colour longevity     otherwise it is a pretty decent watch  one can keep an option of buying it       image says gray but received black  other than this evening nice   this watch omg can t describe how much i loved it    simple yet elegant   i thought it would be too big for my wrist but surprisingly it fits n i just loved it   n yeah am not a very big fan of other colors except silver when it comes to watch but this one made my mind change   the only problem is there is no seal stamp in warranty card   it s not a big deal for me but still it s not a right thing without seal packing an warranty card   thanks amazon for such a amazing product     bought this as a gift for my mom  she loved it the design and detailing are spot on  she loved the colour of the watch  although the dial i feel could have been a little sleeker  but thats subjective the delivery was spot on  very satisfied    i was waiting for this watch to give gift to my wife on her birthday and luckily just before 2 days of her birthday this watch is in stock  my wife really like this watch and the titan brand is always best    the watch is nice but chain showed in pic is silver whereas what you get is a black chain  the packaging is not good  one major concern is that warranty card is not stamped so don t know how we will get it under warranty  as for looks the watch looks nice n elegant    too hype accordingly in price    ya but the strap is black not grey here they misleaded information and pictures of watch    though the watch look classy    even dial is not that big as it s showing       quality and lightweight watch always fan of titian raga     good   it is very nice  sooo beautiful  light weight  gifted by my hubby    i am soo happy    thanks      firstly the watch is light weight   smart looking   has 2 swarovski crystals on it which makes it
